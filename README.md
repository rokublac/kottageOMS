### Customer use cases:
- Handle account information without the neccessity to call supplier. All account changes will trigger a high priority notification alert to top management.
- Create and submit orders to the supplier (no payment gateway, this is still done through whatever financial software the company uses. Probably integrate Xero later down the line)
- View order(s) information such as order status, production progress, supplier notes etc.
- Submit inquries about a specific order
- Search and filter through all of your orders, past and present
- Export orders into spreadsheet format

### Supplier use cases:
- View and manage all orders through the management dashboard. All changes directly reflect to the user-end.
- Search and filter through all orders, past and present.
- Track all order modifications if you're suss about slippery employees tampering with orders through the data monitoring dashboard.
